							<h2>Moody Woody</h2>
							<p>CPSC 599 Assignment 1</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Moody Woody is a friendly Arduino bot who is confused about his emotions most of the time. Since he is shy and can't communicate his feelings, his friends can use switches in order to get insight into his emotions. This project has been inspired by Woody Herman’s album which contains beautiful musical pieces that leaves the person relating to Moody Woody bot.</p>
							<p>There are several components that Moody Woody has which make him special. He uses a 4x5 matrix of LEDs in order to display his emotions to his friends. However, his shyness prevents his friends from emotionally supporting him since they don’t know what Moody Woody is feeling. Luckily, Moody Woody has 2 buttons on each side of the LED Matrix that triggers the display of his emotions onto the matrix. Pressing on the left button will allow his friends to see Moody Woody’s happy emotions whilst pressing on the right button will reveal his sad emotions. If you really want to confuse Moody Woody, you can try pressing on both buttons at the same time which will display a poker face.</p>

								<h3>Assembly #1</h3>
								<p>Make a 4x5 matrix of LEDs that are divided in the breadboard equally.</p>
								<p>Add resistors to the lower half of the matrix</p>
								<p>Test the LEDs by plugging them into power (5V).</p>

								<h3>Assembly #2</h3>
								<p> After successful completion of the previous step, add the remaining resistors to the other half.</p>
								<p> Test the LEDs by plugging them into power (5V).</p>
								<p>Add buttons</p>
								<p>As the last step, connect the LEDs into the board in order to be controlled individually.</p>
